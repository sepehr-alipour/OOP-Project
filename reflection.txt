I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this project, I have learned several concepts of objected oriented programming for developing
modular applications. I had several issues at the beginning of my project while I could implement 
the modules gradually in each milestone.
In milestone 1 I got how the state of an application can handle the errors that may occur in reading 
the data. Also, I could convert the data with formating to the required format.
My favorite file is milestone 2 because I created a dynamic interface menu for having infinite menu items.
That was amazing.
I think the challenges started with milestones 3 and 4. In these two milestones, I implemented whatever I 
learned during the semester like virtual functions, polymorphism, and inheritance. Also, working with input and 
output streams was a tedious attempt that we should read the file properly and save it as well. Finally, I could 
do that and now I can say I am an I/O hard worker.
Overall, this project was a great experience for me because I have submitted everything that I have learned before
and that could be a fantastic portfolio of c++ programming.
